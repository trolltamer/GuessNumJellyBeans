# GuessNumJellyBeans
A coding question based on the wisdom of the crowd theory:

"GuessNumJellyBeans takes an array of ints representing guesses at the number of jelly beans contained in a jar, then based solely on the list of guesses the function returns its best guess as to the number of jelly beans contained in the jar. If there are 2 or more guesses then the function should return the average of all the guesses. If there is only one guess the function should randomly guess either one higher or one lower than the guess. GuessArray has a minimum of one member and can contain infinitely many guesses."
